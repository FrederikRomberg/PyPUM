The first four columns are market and product codes for the year, country, and make as well as quantity sold (No. of new registrations) which will be used in computing observed market shares. The remaining variables consist of car characteristics such as prices, horse power, weight and other physical car characteristics as well as macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita which have been used to construct estimates of the average wage income and purchasing power.\n",
