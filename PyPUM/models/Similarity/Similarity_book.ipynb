The first four columns are market and product codes for the year, country, and make as well as quantity sold (No. of new registrations) which will be used in computing observed market shares. The remaining variables consist of car characteristics such as prices, horse power, weight and other physical car characteristics as well as macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita which have been used to construct estimates of the average wage income and purchasing power.\n",

It allows for multiple nesting structures, and it also allows for 'continuous' nesting by measuring similarity of products in the space of characteristics. Let $g = 1,\\ldots, G$ index a set of distinct nesting structures, and let $\\mathcal{C}_{t} = \\{C_{t1}, \\ldots, C_{tG}\\}$ denote the set containing the spaces of characteristics. To indicate which alternatives $j$ are close to each other in the space of characteristics $C_{tg} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{t}$, we introduce the square matrix $\\psi^g \\in \\mathbb{R}^{J_t \\times J_t}$ constructed in the following way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{G \\times J_{t}}$ be a matrix of characteristics for vehicles $j = 1, \\ldots, J_t$, and suppose we partition the choice set $\\mathcal{J}_t$ according to some discrete variable $w_{(g)}$. For alternatives $j$ and $k$, let the kernel function $K_g(w_{gj} - w_{gk}) = 1(w_{gj} - w_{gk} = 0)$ be the dummy variable on whether choices $j$ and $k$ take the same values in $w_{(g)}$. For continuous variables $w_{(g)}$, we choose the Gaussian kernel function $K_g(w_{gj} - w_{gk}) = e^{-\\frac{(w_{gj} - w_{gk})^2}{2 h_g}}$, where $h_g$ is a bandwidth for nesting structure $g$ determined by Silverman's rule of thumb\n",
    "\n",

    "for all discrete aswell as continuous nesting structures $g = 1, \\ldots, G$, such that the rows $\\psi^g_{(j)}$ correspond to a probability distribution over the choice set. A row $\\psi^g_{(j)}$ may therefore also be interpreted as the similarity of products $k$ to $j$ in the space of the $g$'th characteristic of $W$. Having specified a nesting structure, we define the Similarity pertubation function $\\Omega$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega(q|\\lambda) = \\left( 1 - \\sum_{g = 1}^G \\lambda_g\\right) q' \\ln (q) + \\sum_{g = 1}^G \\lambda_g (\\psi^g q)' \\ln( \\psi^g q) - q' \\delta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^G$ is a vector of nesting parameters and $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{J_t}$ is a normalizing constant vector. If the sum of the positive nesting parameters $\\sum_{g : \\lambda_g > 0} \\lambda_g $ is strictly less than $1$, then the pertubation function $\\Omega(\\cdot|\\lambda)$ is strictly convex, such that the Similarity Model is a perturbed utility Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $q$ and $\\psi^g q$ are probability distributions, wherefore the terms $q'\\ln(q)$ and $(\\psi^g q)' \\ln(\\psi^g q)$ is interpreted as the negative entropy of $q$ and of the probability distribution over nests in $C_g$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing the normalizing factor $\\delta$, we want to normalize the pertubation function such that $\\Omega(q|\\lambda) = 0$ at the corners of the probability simplex $\\Delta$, i.e. when the vector of choice probabilities $q$ contains a probability equal to $0$ or $1$. If $e_j$ is the $j$'th standard basis vector in $R^{J_t}$, then $0 = \\Omega(e_j | \\lambda) = \\left( 1 - \\sum_{g = 1}^G \\lambda_g\\right) \\cdot 0 + \\sum_{g = 1}^G \\lambda_g (\\psi_{[j]}^g)' \\ln( \\psi_{[j]}^g) - \\delta_j$ implies that we must choose $\\delta_j = \\sum_{g = 1}^G \\lambda_g (\\psi_{[j]}^g)' \\ln( \\psi_{[j]}^g)$ to achieve this normalization, where $\\psi_{[j]}^g$ here denotes the $j$'th row of $\\psi^g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if $\\lambda = 0$ then the Similarity Model reduces to the Multinomial Logit Model, since $\\Omega(q|0) = q' \\ln (q)$ is the negative Shannon-entropy, and the Nested Logit Model, as described above, may be obtained if $G = 1$ and $\\delta = 0$. Furthermore, the IPDL Model by Fosgerau et. al (2022) may obtained by setting $\\delta = 0$. Hence the Similarity Model allows for greater flexibility than many workhorse models. "

To reduce overplotting we only plot the rows $\\psi^g_{(j)}$ for a median product $j^g = \\mathrm{med}(X_{t,k(g)})$ of each nesting structure $g$. Clearly, by construction, the distribution of characteristics will be Gaussian."

Since the number of products varies across markets $t$ we aggregate our results according to the categorical variable `cla` describing the class or segment of each vehicle $j$. This variable takes values 'subcompact', 'compact', 'intermediate', 'standard', and 'luxury' encoded as the integers $0,1,\\ldots, 5$ in our dataset. To this end we consider the 'pooled' elasticities and diversion ratios calculated using the directional derivative $\\frac{\\partial q_c}{\\partial u_{\\ell}} = \\sum_{j: x_{j,\\text{cla}} = c} \\sum_{k: x_{k,\\text{cla}} = \\ell} \\frac{\\partial q_j}{\\partial u_k}$ of class $c$ wrt. the utility of class $\\ell$, where $q_c = \\sum_{j: x_{j,\\text{cla}} = c} q_j$ denotes the within-group choice proabbilitity of choosing a car of class $c$. \n",
