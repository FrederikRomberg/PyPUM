============

This repository presents two instances of Pertubed Utility Models: the IPDL Model and the Similarity Model.
Currently, the repository is undergoing maintenance, wherefore files may not run out of the box (e.g. various references between directories and folders are obsolete).
Nonetheless, the notebooks and their functions can easily be made to work in a local directory, 
and they still provide very useful inspiration when implementing IPDL and Similarity models.
