PySimilarity
============

This repository presents the IPDL and Similarity discrete choice models.
Currently, the repository is undergoing maintenance, wherefore files will not run out of the box (e.g. various references between directories and folders are obsolete).
Nonetheless, the notebooks and their functions can easily be made to work in a local directory, 
and they still provide very useful inspiration when implementing IPDL and Similarity models.
